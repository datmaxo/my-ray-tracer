# my-ray-tracer
A C++ rendering engine, built from scratch, in order aid my understanding of the fundamentals.

Right now, scenes have to be created in a rather esoteric manner using .json files.
Eventually, I hope to add functionality to import standard .obj files, as well as a simple UI.

For now, this software is being developed on an M1 Mac.
However, I may have to pivot development to windows, in order to make use of GPU libraries.
